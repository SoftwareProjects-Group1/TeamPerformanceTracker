# TeamPerformanceTracker

This is a Team Performance Tracker created by Group 1 for the Software Projects module.

# Client Requirements (Actemium)

For each of my project teams I would like a way to store and display there performance over the course of the year, we review project financial performance monthly. I would like to be able to enter via a front end project performance as a % (this is how we track it. The system could then aggregate all the team performances, graph them, display over time period etc.
Further to this I would also like a front end to be able to assign teams/team members and to be able to enter productive percentage (productive hours worked/total hours worked) per team member and it to present it as overall productive percent/team based/comparison to other engineers/teams etc.
